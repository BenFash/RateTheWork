## UX

I am looking for a clean and simple design ensuring all essential functions are available and easy to navigate with responsiveness through bootstrap. To create my wireframes I have used Balsamiq and colour scheme inspiration from coolors.co.

### Typography 

#### Font Awesome  
Used to for icons in footer allowing me to present relevant social media links for users.

#### Fonts
To help me with font pairing I used fontpair.co. I settled on the below paring as Oswald's modern and bold style complements Source Sans Pro's clean and neutral design.
- 'Oswald' : Oswald is a bold and condensed font with strong geometric shapes, making it ideal for headlines and titles. Its boldness contrasts well with the lighter weight and more open design of Source Sans Pro, creating visual interest,
- 'Source Sans Pro' : Source Sans Pro is designed for optimal readability on screens ideal for text other than headers.

The overall pairing of Oswald and Source Sans Pro fonts provides a harmonious balance of boldness and readability, making them well-suited for my project.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
